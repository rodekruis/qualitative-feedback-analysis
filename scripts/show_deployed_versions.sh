# Show the application version and infrastructure commit currently deployed to
# each environment, using only the GitHub paper trail — no Azure access needed.
#
# How it works:
#   - Every app deploy and Terraform run declares a GitHub `environment`, so
#     GitHub records a deployment per run. We read the deployments for each
#     environment and follow each one to the workflow that created it.
#   - App deploys (Release / Promote to * / Auto-deploy ...) record their
#     version in the deployment status `description` (e.g. "v2.0.0 @ sha256:..."),
#     written by .github/workflows/_deploy-release.yaml.
#   - Infra applies come from the `Terraform` workflow via `workflow_dispatch`;
#     Terraform `plan` runs (pull_request / push) are skipped — they change
#     nothing. The deployed infra "version" is the run's commit SHA.
#
# For the live app version when the service is up, prefer `GET /v1/health`.
# When the app is down, also check the Azure tags directly:
#   az webapp show -g <resource-group> -n <app-name> --query tags
#
# Usage:   scripts/show_deployed_versions.sh [owner/repo]
# Requires: gh (authenticated) and jq.
